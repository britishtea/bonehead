# Running the tests

Bonehead uses [cutest][https://github.com/djanowski/cutest] for testing. Before 
you attempt to run the tests, make sure to install it (`gem install cutest`). 
Alternatively you can install Bonehead with its development dependencies (`gem 
install bonehead --development`).

The tests can be run with the following command: `cutest test/*_test.rb`.
